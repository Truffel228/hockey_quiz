      text:
          'One of the NHL\'s Original Six teams will be debuting a new third jersey this year. On Friday, the New York Rangers revealed their new alternate uniforms, which center the iconic shield on the front for the first time in decades.\n\nThe Rangers dropped a video on social media in which Mika Zibanejad, Igor Shesterkin and K\'Andre Miller model the new threads. The main color is a darker navy blue, which was recently used on the team\'s Reverse Retro jerseys.\n\nWith the Rangers shield in the middle of the jersey, there is red, white and blue piping at the bottom. On the sleeves and socks, there is a unique style of piping using that same color scheme, which the Rangers say is meant to "emulate The Garden\'s lights, streaking traffic, and the hustle of our city."',

On Thursday, the Canucks announced they sent a 2024 fifth-round pick and a 2026 third-round pick to the Flames in exchange for Zadorov.\n\nZadorov, 28, recently requested a trade out of Calgary while the team was enduring a disappointing start.

With an empty-net tally in the third period, Jarry became the first goalie in Penguins history to score a goal.\n\nWith just over a minute remaining in regulation, the Lightning were pushing for the tying goal when they dumped the puck in on Jarry. The dump-in was quick and right on Jarry's stick, and without hesitation, Jarry flung the puck back down the ice.",

The Flyers took Owen in for the day and even let him do some coaching from the bench during the game.\n\nOwen was diagnosed with cancer when he was just six months old, and he has been battling the disease ever since. Back in July, scans showed that Owen developed new tumors in his brain and spine. The young hockey fan has been fighting his entire life, and he still has a long road ahead of him, but the Flyers gave him a moment of respite on Tuesday.",
